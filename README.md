Quick test for zoopla simple responsive design

Step 1

Step 3 
  Adding styles to 
    Header
    Navbar
    Content
      Articles
      Accordion
    Footer
    
Step 4
  Adding javascript to the accordion

Step 5 
  Add a couple of breakpoints to the styles

Mark up creation

Just relised that this page will have later different layouts.
For that reason I will adding to the skeleton a table layout with divs using row and col to determanate the 
looks and the layout for different viewports


Also there is a submenu needed to be added so might as well adding this to the markup right now
